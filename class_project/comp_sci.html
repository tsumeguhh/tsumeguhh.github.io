            <h2>Program Description</h2>
            <p>Do you want to know how to design and program the computers powering some of today’s
                greatest innovations? Ever wondered how your phone knows where the nearest Starbucks is, how
                Google’s self-driving car is even possible, or how your music and photos live in the cloud? Maybe
                you want to know how computers protect businesses — and people — and other cybersecurity
                issues. AUM’s Computer Science Program, with a curriculum based on the latest ACM/IEEE
                recommendations and an emphasis on high-performance computing, will prepare you for a career
                in computer programming, networking, database management, multimedia design or technology
                architecture.</p>
            <h2>Points of Pride</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You’ll have access to the most powerful computational resources and expertise in the
                    country through our partnership with the NSF-supported Extreme Science and Engineering
                    Discovery Environment.</li>
                <li>Computer Science faculty are engaged in the private sector, supporting research and partnerships with national and international user groups and initiatives.
